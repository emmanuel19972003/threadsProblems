Threading and Concurrency Problems Exploration

# Overview

This project explores various threading, concurrency, and related problems. It is designed with a mixed architecture that leverages dependency injection to dynamically switch logic based on the specific problem being evaluated. The project maintains a single view while altering its internal behavior to test different concurrency scenarios.

# Features

Threading and Concurrency Experiments: Various challenges related to threading and concurrency are implemented and tested.

Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) in UIKit: The project utilizes GCD to handle concurrency effectively within a UIKit environment.

Dependency Injection: The logic adapts dynamically to the selected problem without modifying the UI structure.

Modular Design: Easily extendable to add new concurrency problems and solutions.

Single View Architecture: Ensures a consistent UI while evaluating different concurrency solutions.

# Requirements

Swift

UIKit

# Installation

# Usage

Choose the concurrency problem to evaluate.

The application dynamically loads the corresponding logic using dependency injection.

Observe and analyze the behavior.
